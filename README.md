Projects of the course EQ2341 "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning": the first two assignments implement the code for HMMs including initialization, and the forward and backward algorithms. For the final project, an activity recognition system should be created to distinguish between standing, walking and running. I developed an HMM capable of discriminating among these three states and accurately classifying new data points.
